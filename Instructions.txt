1. Install the included ODBC drivers (Version 18 is required)
2. Run the app right away, the app uses an Azure database so no installation is required
3. Chrome or Edge should be installed

The Connection doesn’t commit the changes by intention, the DB “resets” when the program restarts.

For running the code:

Python 3.11 is needed with the packages:
- matplotlib
- eel
- pyodbc
- pyinstaller (for conversion to .exe)

Simply run main.py

For compiling the exe file run the following command in the code directory (with the package pyinstaller installed):
python3.11 -m eel main.py web --onefile
The exe will be in the dist folder
